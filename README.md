# code-editor
## Team *Coderscode*

**Idea** - A web-based front-end code editor, that provides a live preview of the HTML/CSS/JS code input in the editor.
This editor would be indisputably real-time as the developer won't have to press any button to load the preview as the editor will load it after every keypress.

**Reason for this idea** - As DigitalOcean is know to be a cloud platform exclusively for *developers*, we chose this idea as it would benefit several front-end web developers including us.
A web-app of this kind would need very low latency to improve the site's UX. Since DigitalOcean's data center is now in Bangalore, it would be a very promising platform to host out web-app.

**Using the web app** - 
1. Visit http://139.59.0.244/ to use our web-app that has been hosted on a 512MB/20GB/Ubuntu16 droplet located in Bangalore data center.
2. You now have to load a project that is currently existing in the server. Hence, type one of the following project names into the text box.
  i. jQuery-Todo-master
  ii. Crossword
3. You can then edit the HTML/CSS/JS from the code-editor and get to view the live preview of the code.
